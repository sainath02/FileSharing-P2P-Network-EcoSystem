# FileSharing-P2P-Network-EcoSystem

This project implements a special kind of Peer to Peer application architecture to share large files. This model is used when you have a large demand for a file (or) when you have large files to share over your P2P network. This type of network is usually implemented in Bit-Torrent like FileSharing Systems.
